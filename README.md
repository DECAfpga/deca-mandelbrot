# deca-mandelbrot
The Terasic DECA board as a mandelbrot accelerator.
This is a hobby project to explore parallel computation/pipelining
on a FPGA.

## current status
* working: two 72 bit fixed point mandelbrot cores run at 56 MHz
* still needs improvement: better resource usage, pipelining, more efficient USB data transfer
* very rough client app with hardwired parameters
* produces beautiful images:
